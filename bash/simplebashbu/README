SHORT DESCRIPTION:
A simple BASH script to do nightly backups to tarballs on a hard drive (not to tape)  Ideal for home linux users to easily backup thier system, provided they have an extra hard drive.


DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
This script is designed to run every night via a cron event.  When you install and configure the script, you chose one night a week for the script to perform a full backup.  On other nights it will only back up files that have changed since the last full backup.  All backups result in a tarball of files (compressed if you enable it) written to a directory that you choose.  Options include emailing of results, logging, compression of backups, compression of logs, verbose mode, quiet mode, etc.


ABOUT:
I wrote this script in August of 2001 to backup my home linux box.  Although there were many excellent backup solutions already available, I couldn't find one to meet my needs.  I wanted something to simply create a full, compressed backup of my home RH7 Linux box every week and save that as a compressed tarball (*.tar.gz) on a seperate hard drive.  I did not see any sense in buying a tape drive for my home system when disk drives are dirt cheap, much faster, and in my opinion, more reliable and durable.


WARRANTY:
As fully detailed in the copyright, there is no warranty of any kind on this product.  See link provided in the COPYRIGHT section above for full details.  Always thoroughly test any backup solution you choose.  For what its worth, I do use it to back up my home system.
